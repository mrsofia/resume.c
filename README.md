My resume in C source - For science!

![For science!](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/PantslessForScience.png)

To see it:

First, clone the repo. 

Make sure you have a C compiler installed and ready to go. On a Mac or Unix-like system this should be `gcc` or `cc`.

Then run:

`make resume`

And finally:

`./resume`

Let me know if there are any issues!
