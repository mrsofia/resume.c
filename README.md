My resume in C source - For science!

![For science!](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/PantslessForScience.png)

To see it:

First, clone the repo. 

Make sure you have a C compiler installed and ready to go. The compiler used in my Makefile is `cc`, so make sure you have that, and feel free to change the makefile to suit your setup.

Then run:

`make resume`

And finally:

`./resume`

Let me know if there are any issues!
